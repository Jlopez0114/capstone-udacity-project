# Blue-Green Deployment Project

Welcome to the Blue-Green Deployment Project! This project demonstrates how to implement a blue-green deployment strategy using AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and Docker containers. Blue-green deployment is a technique for releasing updates with minimal downtime and risk by maintaining two identical environments (blue and green), allowing seamless switching between them.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the following steps for implementing a blue-green deployment:

1. Building a Docker container for the application.
2. Deploying the application to the blue environment in an AWS EKS cluster.
3. Setting up the green environment in the same EKS cluster.
4. Switching the traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.
5. Verifying successful deployment and accessibility of the application.
